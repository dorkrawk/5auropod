# 5sauropod
An HTML5/JavaScript based music player.

## So, What Does It Do?
5auropod takes a playlist file (in JSON format) and sets up an HTML5 based music player.  It makes use of the <audio> tag for playback and is subject to browser limitations for supported audio formats.

## Ok, So Why Is It Called 5auropod?
I like dinosaurs, and more importantly I like semi-clever names for things.  [Sauropods](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropoda) were huge long necked dinosaurs.  The word "sauropod" sounds like it almost kinda contains the word "iPod". iPods play music, right?  This thing is built in HTML5, so why not replace the 's' with a 5 like all the cool kids on the internet do?  The result... 5auropod.

## What's Next For Our Hero?
Here's my rough to-do list:
* Playlist view/navigation
* Replace standard <audio> controls
* Automatic playlist generation (?)
